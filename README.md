Chrome plugin to make color code the results of webperf.se detail pages for quicker parsing

To use this plugin use the green "Code" button and download the zip file. Unpack it where you wish to keep it and go to chrome://extensions/ in your browser.
Activate the "developer mode" switch (or "programmerarl√§ge" in swedish) and click the button to load an uncompressed plugin. Then go to the detail page for a website on webperf.se and you should see
the grades being colour coded.

(Accessibility notice: Using colour can never be the only way to convey information, but this is more of an addon on existing information. And you're free to modify the styling to fit your own needs. This is a throwaway plugin I made for my own needs, but if people deem it useful it might be an idea to create a proper admin panel to offer some configuration options.)
